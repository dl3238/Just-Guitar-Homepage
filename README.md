### What is this page about?
Just Guitar is an online community for all guitar lovers. This single-page project has modeled the homepage of this community.

### How did I create this page?
I used **HTML5** and **CSS3** to write this page. Meanwhile, I also used **Bootstrap**, which is a free and open-source CSS framework directed at responsive front-end web development. Features created in this project contained tables, cards, and embeded video from a third-party site (Youtube).
